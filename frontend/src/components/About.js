      <p>
        I'm currently a student in a software engineering bootcamp working on
        skills in front-end and back-end web development. My previous career as
        a professional basketball player overseas has provided me insight into
        my next career move: building and maintaining sports betting/sports
        centered websites that have a great user experience. In this next phase
        of my career, I seek a role as a web developer at a company where I can
        work on solving problems that help make websites function more
        efficiently for everyone involved as well as learn, grow, and continue
        to master my craft.
